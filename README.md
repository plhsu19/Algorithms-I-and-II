### Lab Assignments for Coursera Online Course "Algorithms"
Lectures given by Prof. Robert Sedgewick and Prof. Kevin Wayne (Princeton University)
#### Assignment 1
Use data structure Union-Find to implement classical "Percolation" system and Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the percolation threshold. <br />Details: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php
#### Assignment 2
Implement generic and iterable data structures "Deque" and "Randomized Queue" using linked list and resizing array. <br />Details: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php
#### Assignment 3
Build a "Point" data structure that implements Comparable<> interface and with method returns object-dependent comparator<>. Based on Java's sort() method implement an approach to detect colinear points (line segaments) in a given set of points, i.e., Point data type objects, for computer vision application. <br />Details: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php
#### Assignment4
Create a "Board" data-type that models n-by-n puzzles with sliding tiles. Using binary heap based "Priority Queue" data structure to implement A* algorithm to solve the n-by-n puzzles. <br />Details: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle/faq.php
#### Assignment5: (To be continued)
